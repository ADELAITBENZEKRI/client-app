This is a simple project to run locally on your computer. Follow these easy steps to get it working:

1. **Install Python**:
   - Download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - When installing, make sure to check the option that says "Add Python to PATH."

2. **Install Necessary Libraries**:
   - After Python is installed, you'll need to install a few Python libraries to run the project.
   - Open the "Command Prompt" (Windows) or "Terminal" (Mac) on your computer.

     ```
   - Type the following command and press **Enter**:

     ```

     ```

   - This will open the project in your default web browser. The app will run, and you can interact with it to view and analyze the data.

5. **Uploading Your CSV Data**:
   - When you open the app in your browser, you will see an option to upload your CSV file (this is the data file).
   - Simply click the **"Choose a CSV file"** button and select the CSV file that you want to use.
